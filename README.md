This is an EDA project using MySQL and a popular Kickstarter dataset from Kaggle. 

There are 4 parts to the porject during which I:

1. Set up the environment,
2. Familiarise with the data,
3. Clean the data,
4. Have a deeper dive, and export separate files for use with Tableu in a later visualisation.
